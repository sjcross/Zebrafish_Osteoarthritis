"""
Create DICOM files from the data on RDSF so we have everything nicely paired up and in one place.
DICOM files contain both the original image and its label, so these files are easier to work with
than separate image/label files.

This script works by reading in the TIFF labels and images that live on the RDSF and creating
DICOM files from them, which it then saves to disk. This is useful because it keeps the image
and label together in the same file (we don't want to get confused between files; they may have
different numbering schemes, may be partially labelled, and/or may live in different places on
the RDSF).
It is also much faster to read in a DICOM file than it is to read the TIFFs from the RDSF (which
is a network drive) every time we want to perform inference, train a model, plot something, etc.
There are three basic categories of files at the moment:
 - Training set 1 - Wahab's segmented images
 - Training set 2 - the first set of images that Felix segmented
 - Training set 3 - the second set of images that Felix segmented; only the rear part of the jaw
                    has been segmented.

This script just translates Training sets 2 and 3 directly to DICOMs.
For Training set 1, Wahab has segmented both the jawbones we're interested in and the quadrate
bones - these have been given different labels, so we ignore the quadrates and keep only the
other ones.
